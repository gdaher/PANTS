\title{Plot network diagram for a pathway}
\usage{
plot_pwy(gr, ker, Gmat, pwy, score.v, annot = NA, ntop = 7,
  alternative = c("two.sided", "less", "greater"), name = paste0(gsub(":|/",
  "_", pwy), "_ntop", ntop), color.pal = NULL)
}
\arguments{
\item{gr}{A graph of class \code{igraph} representing the interaction network.}

\item{ker}{Kernel matrix, can be sparse matrix from package \code{Matrix}.}

\item{Gmat}{Pathway membership matrix, can be sparse matrix from package \code{Matrix}.}

\item{pwy}{Pathway to plot. Must be a column name of \code{Gmat}.}

\item{score.v}{Namd vector of scores of features, where \code{names(score.v) == rownames(gr)}, to select top nodes 
and color them.}

\item{annot}{Named vector of annotations for nodes. If \code{annot} is not \code{NA}, \code{names(annot)} should 
have some overlap with \code{rownames(Gmat)}.}

\item{ntop}{Number of top most significant features to include. If one of these is an external node, then its
internal neighbor nodes are also included. These nodes are then connected based on the interaction network.}

\item{alternative}{A character string specifying the alternative hypothesis.}

\item{name}{Name for PDF file to plot to. Can't contain characters ":" or "/" on Windows. Set to \code{NA}
to suppress writing to file.}

\item{color.pal}{A color palette, as a vector. Must be accepted by \code{\link[igraph]{plot.igraph}}. If \code{NULL},
a palette from \code{\link[RColorBrewer]{brewer.pal}} is chosen.}
}
\value{
Invisibly, a list of 3 components: 
\describe{
  \item{gr}{the graph that gets plotted}
  \item{vertex.color}{the vertex colors}
  \item{vertex.size}{the vertex sizes}
}
}
\description{
Plot network diagram for a pathway with node size corresponding to significance and color to pathway membership.
